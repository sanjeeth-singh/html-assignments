        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <blockquote>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</blockquote>
        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Corporate training and Development Experience:</h3>
        <h4>"cognicent technology solutions"</h4>
        <blockquote>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.</blockquote>
        <blockquote>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages.</blockquote>
        <h3>"VLR training solutions"</h3>
        <blockquote>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained.</blockquote>
        <h3>"Digital LYNC pvt limited</h3>
        <blockquote>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification.</blockquote>
